# Project-2
Tracking the climate changes through data analysis

Here is stored the content of our second 3 weeks project, on climate change
We (4 Wild Code School students) had to deliver a 10 pages document, including data analysis, charts and projections to make sense of how the human being activities yield unsustainable changes on the climate and the environement.

Opensources datas have been gathered, cleaned and pre-processed, computations and correlations have been made and conlusions have been drawned.
